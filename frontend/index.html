                        The Underdark is a subterranean wonderland, a vast and twisted labyrinth where fear reigns. It is here 
                        that the dark elf Gromph Baenre, Archmage of Menzoberranzan, casts a foul spell meant to ignite a 
                        magical energy that suffuses the Underdark, and he tears open portals to the demonic Abyss in the process. 
                        What steps through surprises even him, and from that moment on, the insanity that pervades the Underdark 
                        escalates and threatens to shake the Forgotten Realms to its foundations. Stop the madness before it consumes you!

                        Ages ago, giants and dragons waged war across the Savage Frontier. These battles are long forgotten by the human
                        civilizations of today, but ancient relics remain. And now, the land shudders once more with the thunder of giant
                        footsteps. Puny adventurers must rise up to the challenge, gather their strengthm unlock the power of ancient runes,
                        and take the fight to the giants' doorsteps. Only then can they forge an alliance to end the war before it begins.

                        Once every eight years, the fantastic Witchlight Carnival touches down on your world, bringing joy to one settlement after the next. Its owners, Mister 
                        Witch and Mister Light, know how to put on a good show. But there’s more to this magical extravaganza than meets the eye! <br>
                        The carnival is a gateway to a fantastic Feywild domain unlike anything found on the Material Plane. Time has not been kind to this realm, however, and 
                        dark days lie ahead unless someone can thwart the dastardly schemes of the Hourglass Coven.

                        Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep <br>
                        </strong>
                        The greed of mortals has awakened a powerful entity long thought destroyed. For eons, this mighty champion of the gods has been imprisoned in the darkest 
                        depths of Exandria. His name has been forgotten, as have his heroic deeds. Languishing in despair, he calls out for new heroes to save him. <br>
                        Inspired by the campaigns of the hit series Critical Role, this adventure begins in the Wastes of Xhorhas and leads to the glimmering oasis-city of 
                        Ank’Harel on the continent of Marquet, and from there into a sunken realm of gloom, corruption, and sorrow known as the Netherdeep. Above it all, the 
                        red moon of Ruidus watches, twisting the fates of those who have the power to shape the course of history.
